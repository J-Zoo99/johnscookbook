I took this idea from the guys at [Sorted Food](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfyehHM_eo4g5JUyWmms2LA) - I wanted to make a repository of things I'd like to make, but also to have things where ingredients crossed.

I don't claim to be a recipe developer - I basically just combine things that I like from multiple recipes - you'll see a lot of attribution because of this.

 The purpose of this website is two-fold - I want an interconnected map of the foods I cook, the cuisines I eat, and the ingredients I like to use... And some of my friends want some of the recipes I cook, cos I love cooking.
